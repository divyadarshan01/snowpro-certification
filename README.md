# Snowpro certification
## My notes from Snowpro certification

**Learning Snowflake**: Before attending the workshop, I completed a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/snowflake-essentials/) on Udemy which covers all the important aspects of Snowflake needed for clearing the certification. Please go through this complete course if you don’t have any knowledge of Snowflake. If you are already aware of the concepts of Snowflake, move on to the next step.
**Snowflake University**: Once you understand the concepts of Snowflake, register yourself at [Snowflake University](http://snowflakeuniversity.mindtickle.com/), go through all the courses. There will be practice questions also, go through them carefully as there will be many questions repeating in the actual exam. There will be one section “Snowpro Cert resources”. In this section, there will be one downloadable pdf that will clearly mention the weightage of each section along with a link to Snowflake docs. Sample examination of 30 questions is also very useful along with two modules of 60 questions each.
**Practice Test**: Go through all the questions of [this practice test](https://www.udemy.com/course/snowflake-snowpro-core-certification-practice-exams/) hosted on Udemy. It is very helpful in understanding a lot of concepts that you may have missed. Go through the explanations of answers and click on the official docs link provided. Understand the concepts.
**Snowflake Docs**: Going through Snowflake docs is a MUST. You must go through all the important topics and topics covered in the practice exam mentioned in the previous step. Read through the points and try to understand the internal functionality. Although actual examination will not ask concepts in detail, there may be a few questions which you will be able to guess correctly if basic concepts are clear.
**Youtube playlist**: Once you are confident, just go through this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYibSRsdbwo&list=PL8P3u3jjMVVlOo_ZzuT-iVFrYwkDZu-7u) for revision.

I also took help from this [cheatsheet](https://medium.com/weareservian/snowflakes-snowpro-certification-exam-preparation-guide-how-to-pass-in-3-days-5e5baa484c68) which very succinctly covers all the important points.

Few tips from my personal experience:
a) Examination is not very difficult but the cut-off score is high so make sure that you are well prepared.
b) In the multiple-choice answers, the total number of correct answers expected will be mentioned in the question itself which is very helpful
c) There will be few questions for which I could not find answers even in the official documentation after clearing the examination. The best you could do is take an intelligent guess, which you will be able to do if you have gone through official docs in detail.
d) There are no scenario-based questions in the exam
e) There will not be any SQL syntax or output based questions.
f) In case of doubt, mark the question for review as you may get the hint from the next questions.
g) Don’t worry about the time limit. If you have prepared well, you should be able to complete all the questions in 30 minutes or so.
